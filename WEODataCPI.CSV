213,ARG,Argentina,"Inflation, average consumer prices",Index,"Source: National Statistics Office Latest actual data: 2014 Notes: Consumer price data from December 2013 onwards reflect the new national CPI (IPCNu), which differs substantively from the preceding CPI (the CPI for the Greater Buenos Aires Area, CPI-GBA). Because of the differences in geographical coverage, weights, sampling, and methodology, the IPCNu data cannot be directly compared to the earlier CPI-GBA data. Because of this structural break in the data, the average CPI inflation for 2014 is not reported in the October 2015 World Economic Outlook. Following a declaration of censure by the IMF on February 1, 2013, the public release of a new national CPI by end-March 2014 was one of the specified actions in the IMF Executive Board?s December 2013 decision calling on Argentina to address the quality of its official CPI data. On June 3, 2015, the Executive Board recognized the ongoing discussions with the Argentine authorities and their material progress in remedying the inaccurate provision of data since 2013, but found that some specified actions called for by end-February 2015 had not yet been completely implemented. The Executive Board will review this issue again by July 15, 2016, and in line with the procedures set forth in the IMF legal framework.
