### Hypotheses:
##### •Countries which have higher GDP and CPI are happier
##### •Countries which have bigger ecological footprints are happier
##### •The people who live in happier countries are healthier

### Conclusion
Countries which have higher GDP are happier, but CPI has not obvious relationship with  happies.<br>
With the increase in carbon emissions per capita, countries will gain higher happiness scores. However, after they reach the maximum score, more carbon emission will cause a decrease in the happiness score.<br>
After analyzing the countries from 2015 to 2017, we conclude that countries which are happier have longer life expectancy.  People in happier countries are healthier.
